### About / Design
The function of the design is a general knowledge quiz for fans of [dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) comparing two
heros in a head to head.

The two heroes shown should not be identical, and should have different values for the question asked e.g. movement speed.

On loading, the page will automatically generate a question based on the values stored in the javascript.

After answering a question, the browser will alert the user to wether they answered correctly/incorrectly,
before generating another random question.

### Features
The webpage features a background image from the Dota 2 website.
